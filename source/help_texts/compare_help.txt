Manual for the compare command:

[-p] [--compare      [match_file fp_file out_file]]

This command is used to calculate the average similartiy scores of a
set of fingerprints, when comparing them to the resulting substances
of a matching process. The output file will contain the average 
similarity score for every compound of the given fingerprint file, as
well as an overall average of all given compounds. The used fingerprint
types have to be the same in the match_file and fp_file 


Input Arguments:


match_file: The match_file argument should be a file path relative to the 
	    program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	    should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
   	    ones generated by the mathcing command. 


fp_file: The fp_file argument should be a file path relative to the 
	 program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	 should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
	 ones generated by the fingerprints command. 


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to to create the output. The given name will be used
	  for the standard compare file.


Example format out_file:

Average Similarity scores of all compounds:

compound1 0.95
compound2 0.55
compound3 0.63
