Manual for the matching command:

[-m] [--matching     [combine_file out_file (optional:True/False)]]

This command is used to create a matching file, containing the
SIDs, SureChEMBL IDs, similarity scores and patent IDs of the 
compounds, that have the 10 highest similarity scores when comparing 
with an combined fingerprint. The combined fingeprint gets compared
to the fingerprints of all SureChEMBL compounds, respecting the 
fingerprint type used for the combined fingerprint. The resulting
file will be sorted by the similarity scores.


Input Arguments: 


combine_file: The combine_file argument should be a file path relative to
	      the program, representing the file that contains the data, 
	      that should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as
	      the standard files generated by the combine comand.


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to to create the output.

optional: If value is set to True, the SureChEMBL components used for 
	  matching will be filtered beforehand. If value is set to 
	  False no filtering will be performed. Value is set to true
	  per dafult.


Example format out_file:

	--------------- Top 1 ---------------

	SID:000001,    SureChEmbl_ID:0000001,   Similarity_score:0.90
	PatentID: patent_ID_1, patent_ID_2, patent_ID_3


	--------------- Top 2 ---------------


Example console input to run the comand:

main.py -m combine.asc output/matching.asc
main.py --matching combine.asc output/matching.asc true
main.py -m combine.asc output/matching.asc False
