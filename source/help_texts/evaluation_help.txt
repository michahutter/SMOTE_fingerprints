Manual for the evaluation command:

[-e] [--evaluation   [compare_file1 compare_file2 out_file (optional:float(0-1))]]
[-e] [--evaluation   [all_scores_file out_file]]

Depending on the given input this command evaluates different kinds 
of data. In the case of the input being two compare files and an 
out_file, it generates a histogram per compare file, displaying the
similarity scores found in the compare files. Additionally a Mann-
Whitney-U test will be performed, using the values found in the two
compare files. The resulting p-value will be evaluated using the pre-
defined significance level 0.05 or a chosen level. The results, as 
well as the test statistic U, will be written to a file.
In the case of the input being an all_scores file and an out_file.
A histogram visualizing the entries found in the all_scores file 
will be generated. 


Input Arguments:


In case of two compare files:


compare_file1: The compare_file1 argument should be a file path relative
 	       to the program, representing the file that contains the
	       data, that should be used. The file needs to be of the 
	       same form as the ones generated by the compare command.
	       The two compare files should be genrated on the same
	       matching_file basis.


compare_file2: The compare_file2 argument should be a file path relative
 	       to the program, representing the file that contains the
	       data, that should be used. The file needs to be of the 
	       same form as the ones generated by the compare command.
	       The two compare files should be genrated on the same
	       matching_file basis.


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to to create the output. the given name will be used
	  for the Mann_Whitney_U test results. This name will have the
	  added suffixes '_hist1.png' and '_hist2.png' for the two 
	  histograms that are being generated for the visual 
	  representation of the data found in the two compare files.


optional: Significance level to be used in mann-Whitney-U test.

Example console input to run the command:

main.py -e input/compare1.asc input/compare2.asc output/evaluation1.asc
main.py -e input/compare1.asc input/compare2.asc output/evaluation2.asc 0.01


In case of an all_scores file:


all_scores_file: The all_scores_file argument should be a file path relative
 	         to the program, representing the file that contains the
	         data, that should be used. The file needs to be of the 
	         same form as the ones generated during the execution of the
		 matching command.


out_file : The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	   program, representing the name that should be used for the  
	   histogram being generated.


Example console input to run the command:

main.py -e input/all_scores_file.asc output/eval1.png
