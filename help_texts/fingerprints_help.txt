Manual for the fingerprint command:

[-f] [--fingerprints [in_file out_file fp_type]]

This command is used to create a fingerprint file, containing original 
SMILES representations, names of the compounds, length of the 
generated and the serialized fingerprint and the serialized finger-
print itself.


Input Arguments:


in_file: The in_file argument should be a file path relative to the 
	program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	should be used. The file needs to contain: the SMILES repre-
	sentation of a compound in the first column and the 
	corresponding name in the second column. Colums have to be 
	seperated by single whitespace characters. Any additional data
	in extra columns will be ignored. The data will be read line 
	by line and the reading stops at the end of the file. The given
	file has to be a .txt file.

example format in_file: 

SMILES1 name1
SMILES2 name2
SMILES3 name3 (extra is ignored)


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	program, representing the file that should be created and 
	written to to create the output. The first line in the out_
	file is a header giving information about the data contained in
	this file. The first column containing the SMILES representations, 
	the second column containing the corresponding names, third 
	column containing the size of the generated and compromised byte
	representation of the fingerprint, and the forth column containing
	the generated fingerprints, using the fingerprint type displayed
	in the header. The out_file will be an .asc file, if no extension
	was given, will be added automatically.

Example format out_file:

compound name size MACCS
SMILES1 name1 58 byte_object1
SMILES2 name2 60 byte_object2

Note: Size of the byte objects does not represent the actual length of the
      fingerprint. 


fp_type: This argument should be one of the following possibilities:
	MACCS, Morgan, Atom pairs, Topological Torsion, 2D Pharmacophore. 
	These are the supported fingerprint types in this program. More info
	about the finegrprint sitself can be found on the rdkit website.


Example console inputs to run the comand:

main.py -f datasets/file1.txt output/fingerpints1.asc MACCS
main.py -f datasets/file1.txt output/fingerpints1.asc Morgan
