Manual for the statistic command:

[-s] [--statistic    [fp_file out_file]]

This comand is used to create a statistics file, containing a
list of given compounds and the rate of how many times each bit
is set in the fingerprints of those compounds. Additionally, a
bar chart is created which visualizes thi information.


Input Arguments: 


fp_file: The fp_file argument should be a file path relative to the 
	 program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	 should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
	 ones generated by the fingerprints comand. All compounds found
	 in this file will be taken into account.


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to for the output.

Example format out_file:

	Used compounds:

	compound_1
	compound_2

	Information about how many times particular bits are set:

	Bit0 0.0
	Bit1 0.5
	Bit2 1


Example console input to run the comand:

main.py -s fingeprints.asc statistics.asc
