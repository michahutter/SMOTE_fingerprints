Manual for the ranks command:

[-r] [--ranks        [in_file out_file (optional:invert)]]

This command is used to create a ranks file, containing all 
active names and their summed up Manhatten distances to all
inactives. The rows in the out_file will be ranked by their
Manhatten distance sum. By default the entries will be 
sorted in descending order. However by giving the invert
argument they will be sorted in ascending order.


Input arguments:


in_file: The in_file argument should be a file path relative to the 
	 program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	 should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
	 ones generated by the distances comand.


out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to to create the output. The first line in the out_file
	  is a header giving information about the data contained in the
	  file. The first column contains the active names and the second
	  column contains the summed up Manhatten distances for the
	  compounds. 


example format out_file:

name distance_sum
active_name_1 1600
active_name_2 1500


Example console inputs to run the comand:

main.py -r distances.asc ranks.asc
main.py -r distances.asc ranks.asc invert
