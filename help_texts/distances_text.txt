Manual for the distances command:

[-d] [--distances    [in_file1 in_file2 out_file]]

This command is used to create a distances file, containing all
active names paired together with all inactive names and the
corresponding Manhatten distance between the two compounds.
The distance file will be organised in a way, that all entries
belonging to one active are grouped together. Meaning they are
written underneath eachother until all entries for that active are
listed. The same fingerprint type has to be used for in_file1 and 
in_file2.


Input Arguments:


in_file1: The in_file1 argument should be a file path relative to the 
	  program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	  should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
	  ones generated by the fingerprints comand. This file should 
	  contain compounds that have an pharmaceutical effect on the
	  target that is supposed to be investigated.


in_file2: The in_file2 argument should be a file path relative to the 
	  program, representing the file that contains the data, that
	  should be used. The file needs to be of the same form as the
	  ones generated by the fingerprints comand. This file should
	  contain compounds that work as decoys and would compete with
	  the actives for binding to the target. However, they do not
	  have the same effect on the target.
	

out_file: The out_file argument should be a file path relative to the
	  program, representing the file that should be created and 
	  written to to create the output. The first line in the out_file
	  is a header giving information about the data contained in 
	  the file. The first column contains the actives names, the
	  second column contains the inactives names and the third 
	  column contains the Manhatten distance of these two compouns.

exampled format out_file:

active inactive distance
active_name_1 inactive_name1 12
active_name_1 inactive_name2 10


Example console inputs to run the comand:

main.py -d actives.asc inactives.asc output/distances.asc
